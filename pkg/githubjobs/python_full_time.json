We have multiple openings for recent graduates with a background in computer science and/or software engineering.</p>\n<h2>Job Mission</h2>\n<p>ASML leads the worldwide development, production and sales of high-end lithography systems for the semiconductor industry. In short, we make the machines that make computer chips, or integrated circuits. We build some of the most amazing, complex machines that you will ever see – and the software to run them – to develop smaller, faster and still more affordable chips. It is because of our machines that the world’s technology has steadily evolved.</p>\n<p>Metrology software orchestrates the behavior of powerful mechatronic modules, so that together they achieve an extraordinary combination of speed and accuracy. For example, one such module, the wafer stage, accelerates faster than a fighter jet to enable the ASML machine to position a silicon wafer with nanometer accuracy in less than one second! ASML also uses metrology systems to measure and compensate for sub-nanometer inaccuracies that inevitably appear due to material imperfections, temperature fluctuations, or atmospheric pressure changes. Only the most advanced metrology systems ever imagined can do the job.</p>\n<h2>Job Description</h2>\n<p>We are looking for metrology software designers. Your role is to design high-quality software, allowing fast and efficient delivery of complex metrology functions.
